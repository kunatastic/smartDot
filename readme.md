This is my first genetic algorithm based ML model made in P5. 
This model just finds the shortest path from spawn location to the goal.
This model uses the information gained by the previous generations and takes the best node and replicates the same and improve.


### Main concepts involved:

1. Fitness function
2. Learning Rate
3. Natural selection
4. Mutation of the selection

### Reference
